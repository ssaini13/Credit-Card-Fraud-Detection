## Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Credit card fraud happens when consumers give their credit card number to unfamiliar individuals, when cards are lost or stolen, when mail is diverted from the intended recipient and taken by criminals, or when employees of a business copy the cards or card numbers of a cardholder.

In this notebook we will develop a few ML models using anonymized credit card transaction data. The challenge behind fraud detection is that frauds are far less common as compared to legal transactions.

Non-fraud transactions: 99.83%;
Fraud transactions: 0.17%

Random Forest and XGBoost Classifiers with SMOTE gave us the best results being able to detect more than 80% fraud transactions and at the same time not classifying a lot of non-fraud transactions as fraud.
